TOURS TEAM Budapest Buddies CONTACT FAQ

Your questions. Our answers.

Why don’t you let me book a tour for more than 10 people?
Our tours are designed for you and your closest friends, this is why we have a limit. We want you to have an intense deep dive in our city and that is simply not possible with larger groups. If you'd like we can split you up in several groups though. :)

What if I have to cancel my booking?
No worries, just shoot us an email and we'll take care of it. If you cancel your reservation prior to the payment deadline, you don't have to pay anything. If you cross that we have to take a 40% cancellation fee.

How is your English / German / Spanish / French / Japanese? I got burned before with tour guides who could barely speak my language.
We got you covered there, we promise. :) All of us speak English, most of us speak another language and Sara and Peter actually have a master's in linguistics. ;)

Can you book us accommodations?
Yep, sure we can. Just check the "Find me a place to stay" box in your reservation and we'll contact you about the details.
